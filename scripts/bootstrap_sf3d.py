"""Install Stable Fast 3D: its code and compiled extensions, then its gated weights.

Two halves, the same way the viewer tracks every backend. The **code** is Stability's
repository in `vendor/stable-fast-3d`, installed into this interpreter together with its
two compiled extensions, a texture baker and a UV unwrapper:

- **Apple Silicon:** the baker is built with Metal. It needs Homebrew's `libomp`.
- **Linux or Windows with an NVIDIA card:** the baker is built with CUDA when the CUDA
  toolkit (`nvcc`) matches this PyTorch, and with its CPU kernel otherwise. The model runs
  on the GPU either way. Windows needs the Visual Studio C++ build tools to compile those
  extensions (see `docs/WINDOWS.md`).

The **weights** are SF3D itself (3.8 GB, **gated**: accept Stability's licence on Hugging
Face and log in first) and DINOv2 (1.1 GB), which SF3D would otherwise fetch unannounced
on its first run.

Install into Python 3.10 or 3.11: SF3D pins numpy 1.26 and transformers 4.42.

`AGENTS.md`: a download path must name the backend, name the route, state the size, and
require an affirmative answer. This prints all of that and stops, unless `--yes` is given
for non-interactive use. Defaulting to yes is not allowed, so it does not.

    python scripts/bootstrap_sf3d.py            # says what it wants, then asks
    python scripts/bootstrap_sf3d.py --yes      # for the viewer and for agents
    python scripts/bootstrap_sf3d.py --code-only
    python scripts/bootstrap_sf3d.py --weights-only
