# Image to 3D Lab

![Three source images above the textured 3D models generated from them: a photoreal warrior bust, a stylised garden gnome, and a multi-object shoe-house diorama](docs/images/one-image-in-textured-model-out.jpg)

**Turn a single image into a textured 3D model on your own machine (an Apple Silicon
Mac, or Linux/Windows with an NVIDIA card), with a license-provenance record for every result.**

Apple Silicon deserves more love in the 3D and Imagen community. So this is an attempt at that. 


Drop in a picture of a character or object; get back a `.glb` (with PBR texture) plus a
`.provenance.json` sidecar recording exactly how it was made and under which licenses. This should make your game-dev or whatever else you're up to easier to manage.
Everything runs on your machine; nothing is uploaded to a cloud service.

**Pixel Match: your picture's real pixels, on the model.** Image-to-3D models redraw your
picture, so text, logos and faces come back as garbled lookalikes. Pixel Match, in the
**Finish** step, copies the real pixels from your source image back onto every surface the
image can see. "VANGUARD 07" on a chest stays "VANGUARD 07", even after Finish cuts the
model down to ~5k faces. On by default for Pixal3D models made in the lab; other backends
and more camera angles are next. [How Finish works](#finishing-an-asset).

## Install

**Mac (Apple Silicon) or Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bingeljell/image-to-3dlab/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows + NVIDIA** (limited testing, more testers wanted: tell us how it goes):
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bingeljell/image-to-3dlab/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Full Windows walkthrough (CUDA driver floor, Blender, which backends work, Mac-only
alternatives): **[`docs/WINDOWS.md`](docs/WINDOWS.md)**.

The installer is short, so [read it](install.sh) before you run it
([Windows version](install.ps1)). It checks your machine, installs the code and
Python 3.11 (with CUDA PyTorch on NVIDIA Windows), and prints how to start the viewer. It
downloads **no model weights**: you choose those in **Setup & Status**, which states each
size and licence and asks first. To update, run the same line again.

For scripts and agents: `curl -fsSL …/install.sh | bash -s -- --yes --dir ~/lab`
(`--dry-run` shows what it would do).

**No picture to start from?** There is now a **Generate Image** tab that makes one. Type a
prompt, get a source image, hand it to **Generate 3D**. It runs Qwen-Image 2.1 on your own
machine: about four and a half minutes an image on an M-series Mac, about twenty seconds
on an RTX 4090.

![Three creatures generated from text prompts on a laptop, about four and a half minutes each](docs/images/prompt-to-source-image.jpg)

Built with Qwen. Candidly, Qwen's licence is a bit ambiguous. Qwen says the pictures you
generate are yours ([their statement](https://x.com/QwenDevs/status/2101917379785838660)), but the [licence](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Image-2.1/blob/main/LICENSE) still says the model
is for non-commercial use. Our reading is that commercial work needs a licence from Qwen;
if you plan to go commercial, check their licence yourself. The pipeline keeps those runs in
their own folder and says so in the sidecar. Bring your own image and none of that applies.

Five backends, one Generate 3D page. Sadly life is full of trade-offs, so pick the tradeoff you want (lol):

| Backend | Best for | Runs on | Setup | License |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Pixal3D (C++/GGML)** ⭐ | Best results we have; one pass, no repaint needed | Mac, NVIDIA (Linux/Windows) | Setup & Status, or `scripts/bootstrap_pixal3d.py` (8.4 GB weights) | MIT (code + flow weights); DINOv3 License (bundled encoder) |
| **Hunyuan3D** | Fast, clean results | Mac (MLX) and NVIDIA (CUDA, in-lab) | Mac: `hunyuan_mlx/`; NVIDIA: `scripts/bootstrap_hunyuan_cuda.py` | MIT (MLX code) / Tencent license (CUDA code + all weights) |
| **Hunyuan3D-MLX (dgrauet shape + Xiong paint)** | The cleanest shapes, at the cost of manual setup | Mac only | Cloned separately, manual | Tencent Community License (code + weights) |
| **TRELLIS.2** | Highest fidelity, closest to the official demo | Mac (Metal port) and NVIDIA (CUDA, in-lab) | Mac: Setup & Status; NVIDIA: `scripts/bootstrap_trellis_cuda.py` | MIT + DINOv3 License |
| **Stable Fast 3D** | Fastest, lower fidelity | Mac, NVIDIA (Linux/Windows) | Setup & Status, or `scripts/bootstrap_sf3d.py` (gated weights; Windows needs VS Build Tools) | Stability AI Community License |

⭐ Start with **Pixal3D**. It keeps flat, saturated colours in a single pass, where
TRELLIS.2 often needs a separate repaint.

On NVIDIA, TRELLIS.2 and Hunyuan3D-2.1 install into `vendor/` and run through the same
Generate 3D tab and CLI as the Mac ports (see [`docs/WINDOWS.md`](docs/WINDOWS.md)).

  <sub>The warrior above, turned through 360°. Pixal3D, one pass, no repaint stage.<br>
  Every model on this page came from a single image.</sub>
</p>

Hunyuan3D-MLX (Xiong, full pipeline) remains the quickest to get running from a fresh clone
(~9 min shape+paint end to end at its default model).
Reach for TRELLIS.2 when fidelity matters more than speed. Its material model can produce
severe colour drift on flat/vector-style illustrations; prefer photographs or softly lit
3D-style references. See [picking a picture for TRELLIS.2](docs/trellis2-flat-illustration-colour-drift.md).

## Setting up a backend

Go to **Generate**, pick a backend from the dropdown. Each one has its own **Setup**
status telling you exactly what's missing:

- **Hunyuan3D-MLX (Xiong, full pipeline)**: the code is already there (tracked in this
  repo at `hunyuan_mlx/`). Run once per machine:
  ```bash
  uv sync --project hunyuan_mlx/shape
  uv sync --project hunyuan_mlx/paint
  hunyuan_mlx/shape/.venv/bin/python hunyuan_mlx/download_weights.py
  ```
  Downloads the 2.0 shape model plus the paint weights from Hugging Face, about 13 GB,
  and prints the sizes before it starts. `--model 2.1` or `--model 2.0-turbo` fetches a
  different one; `--all` fetches every shape model, which is about 24 GB and more than
  the default route uses. Full detail: [`docs/hunyuan-mlx-recipes.md`](docs/hunyuan-mlx-recipes.md).
- **Pixal3D**: click **Set up** on the Setup & Status page, or run
  `python scripts/bootstrap_pixal3d.py`. It says what it will download and asks first. On a
  Mac it compiles with Metal (needs full Xcode). On NVIDIA Linux with the CUDA toolkit it
  compiles for your card (a few minutes, once, and about twice as fast to run); otherwise
  on Linux or Windows it fetches a ready-made CUDA build (driver 575+). It also installs
  BiRefNet-lite, the background remover (224 MB), so thin and light-coloured parts survive
  the cut-out.
- **Stable Fast 3D**: accept Stability's licence at
  [huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-fast-3d](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-fast-3d),
  run `hf auth login`, then set it up from Setup & Status or run
  `python scripts/bootstrap_sf3d.py`. On Windows you also need the Visual Studio C++ build
  tools (see [`docs/WINDOWS.md`](docs/WINDOWS.md)).
- **TRELLIS.2**:
  - **Mac:** **Run setup** (Metal port, ~1h) or `python scripts/bootstrap_trellis_space_macos.py`.
  - **NVIDIA:** Setup & Status or `python scripts/bootstrap_trellis_cuda.py` (clones
    official microsoft/TRELLIS.2 into `vendor/trellis2-cuda`; needs CUDA toolkit, and on
    Windows VS C++ build tools).
  First Generate run downloads ~14 GB. **Before that:** request gated DINOv3 access at
  [huggingface.co/facebook/dinov3-vitl16-pretrain-lvd1689m](https://huggingface.co/facebook/dinov3-vitl16-pretrain-lvd1689m)
  and run `hf auth login`.
- **Hunyuan3D (shape + paint)**:
  - **Mac (MLX):** code in `hunyuan_mlx/`; `uv sync` + `download_weights.py`.
  - **NVIDIA (CUDA):** Setup & Status or `python scripts/bootstrap_hunyuan_cuda.py`
    (official Hunyuan3D-2.1 into `vendor/hunyuan3d-cuda`, ~10 GB weights after confirm).
- **Hunyuan3D-MLX (dgrauet shape + Xiong paint)**: Apple Silicon only; manual vendor clone.

Then drop a **pre-masked PNG** (transparent background), pick your settings, hit
**Generate**. Progress streams live; the GLB lands in `output/`. You can also **Compare**
two models side by side in the same viewer.

## CLI

Same engines without the browser.

**Pixal3D:**
```bash
python scripts/pixal3d_generate.py input.png output.glb --seed 42
```
A pre-matted RGBA image skips background removal entirely and keeps the cutout identical to
whatever else you ran on it. Pixal3D runs at 1024, the only resolution its single-image
mode supports. It takes 8 sampling steps by default, 15-30% faster than 12 with the same
shape; pass `--steps 12` for a hero asset. The 8-step default needs a Pixal3D built from
source (every Mac, and Linux with the CUDA toolkit); the prebuilt NVIDIA download (Linux
and Windows) runs 12.

**Hunyuan3D-MLX (Xiong, full pipeline):**
```bash
hunyuan_mlx/shape/.venv/bin/python scripts/hunyuan_mlx_xiong_generate.py \
    input.png output.glb --model 2.0
```

### Reproducible runs

For a run you can audit or repeat later, use a manifest; it records the input, the
backend, every parameter and the licensing intent the run was gated on:

```bash
cp manifests/example-trellis2.json manifests/my-run.json
# point "input.path" at your own image, then:
python pipeline.py --run-manifest manifests/my-run.json
```

Paths inside a manifest resolve relative to the manifest file, not your working
directory. Manifests you write land in `manifests/` and stay local; only the template is
tracked. See [`manifests/README.md`](manifests/README.md).

**TRELLIS.2** (after the bootstrap):
```bash
vendor/trellis-space-mac/.venv/bin/python scripts/trellis_space_generate.py input.png output/out.glb
```
- `--check` verifies the environment first (seconds, no model load).
- Resume modes skip the expensive parts:
  - `--from-latents out_latents.pt`: skip sampling (stages 1–3), re-decode + bake
  - `--from-decode out_decode.pt`: skip sampling, decode **and** model load (bake only)
- Every run writes `<out>.glb`, `<out>_latents.pt`, `<out>_decode.pt`, and a `.json` manifest
  with exact params and per-stage timings.
- In the web UI, a failed TRELLIS decode or bake retains `<out>_latents.pt` even when
  **Debug** is off, so the expensive sampling stage can be resumed. Successful non-debug
  runs clean up the checkpoint after the GLB is safely written.

## Finishing an asset

Generated assets arrive dense and heavy, often ~900k faces and 30+ MB, nearly all of it
uncompressed texture. The **Finish** page in the viewer, and the same chain on the CLI,
brings that down without a visible quality cost:

```bash
python scripts/retopo_repaint.py generated.glb source.png finished.glb \
    --faces 40000 --skip-paint
```

Up to four stages; Finish in the viewer runs retopologise, Pixel Match and compress by
default:

1. **Retopologise**: voxel-remesh, then decimate. The ordering matters: decimating the raw
   mesh shatters thin geometry, measured.
2. **Repaint** (optional, Apple Silicon): hands the clean mesh to Hunyuan 2.1 PBR and
   paints from the source art. Pixal3D output rarely needs it, so it is off by default
   (`--skip-paint` on the CLI) and a finish takes seconds instead of ~6 minutes.
3. **Pixel Match**: every surface the source picture can see takes its real pixel, so
   text, logos, numbers and faces stay exact instead of redrawn lookalikes. Automatic for
   Pixal3D models made in the lab (their camera is found for you); on the CLI pass
   `--views <run>.svviews`, or use `scripts/photo_paint.py` on its own. Surfaces the
   picture cannot see keep the generator's paint.
4. **Compress**: re-encodes the textures. The paint stage emits two uncompressed 4096²
   PNGs; core-glTF JPEG at 2048 measures below the renderer's own sampling noise and takes a
   typical asset from 32 MB to under 5.

Every run writes a JSON record of the settings used, so a batch of finished assets is
comparable rather than each one being tuned by hand.

## Blender animation recipes

The reusable Blender tooling lives in `scripts/blender_*.py`: import, inspect,
stage, bake, render, rig and rebind helpers that work on any mesh this pipeline
produces. **[`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) indexes every tool in the
repository**, grouped by what you are trying to do, and is kept honest by a test
that reads each script's own docstring.

Per-creature rigs and animations are **not** shipped. They lived here once and
were model-specific references rather than drop-in tools, so they now sit in a
git-ignored `characters/<name>/` folder alongside their tests. The techniques are
documented in `docs/`; the creature-specific scripts are ours, not yours. The
[quadruped pipeline](docs/quadruped-pipeline.md) walks through rigging a four-legged
character with them.

## Requirements

| Thing | Why |
|---|---|
| Apple Silicon Mac (M-series), 32 GB recommended | Every route in this lab |
| **or** Linux/Windows with an NVIDIA card (24 GB VRAM tested; Pixal3D's authors run it on 16 GB) | Pixal3D, Stable Fast 3D, Generate Image (see [`docs/WINDOWS.md`](docs/WINDOWS.md)) |
| macOS: full Xcode | compiles the Metal kernels for Pixal3D and TRELLIS |
| Windows: NVIDIA driver 575+ for Pixal3D's prebuilt; VS Build Tools (C++) for SF3D | see [`docs/WINDOWS.md`](docs/WINDOWS.md) |
| Blender 4.2+ | Finish (low-poly clean-up, Pixel Match) and rigging. Install it yourself from [blender.org](https://www.blender.org/download/); Setup & Status shows whether it was found |
| `uv` | builds the reproducible Python environments |
| Python 3.11 (TRELLIS) / 3.12 (Hunyuan3D-MLX) | pinned by each backend's own setup |
| ~13 GB disk | Hunyuan3D-MLX 2.0 shape + paint weights (auto-downloaded once) |
| ~14 GB disk | TRELLIS.2-4B weights (auto-downloaded once, if using TRELLIS) |
| ~94 MB download | TinyCLIP flat-input advisor (local and non-blocking) |
| ~224 MB download | BiRefNet-lite background remover (comes with Pixal3D; otherwise Setup & Status or `scripts/bootstrap_matte.py`) |

## How long a run takes

Rough times for one run on a base M5 MacBook (32 GB); the RTX 4090 column is from a rented
cloud GPU. Yours will differ with the machine and the picture.

| Step | M5 MacBook, 32 GB | RTX 4090 |
|---|---|---|
| Text to image (Qwen-Image) | ~4.5 min | ~20 s |
| Image to 3D (Pixal3D) | ~6 min | ~3 min |
| Image to 3D (Hunyuan3D) | ~9 min (MLX) | CUDA in-lab (`bootstrap_hunyuan_cuda.py`) |
| Image to 3D (TRELLIS.2) | 15–35 min (Metal) | CUDA in-lab (`bootstrap_trellis_cuda.py`) |

On a Mac, TRELLIS.2 runs about twice as fast with **Attention backend** set to `mlx`.

## Licensing & provenance (non-negotiable)

- **Pixal3D** code and flow weights: MIT. The Q8_0 bundle also carries the **DINOv3** image
  encoder under its own licence, so treat its output the same as TRELLIS's. Background
  removal uses BiRefNet-lite (MIT) once installed, `rembg`'s u2net otherwise, and never
  BRIA RMBG-2.0.
- **TRELLIS.2** code and weights: MIT. **DINOv3** image encoder: separate DINOv3 License,
  so TRELLIS output is classified `commercial-conditional`.
- **TinyCLIP ViT-8M/16** input advisor: MIT. It only warns about risky input style and is
  not part of the generated artifact.
- **Hunyuan3D-2 / 2.1 model weights** (used by both Hunyuan3D-MLX backends): Tencent
  Hunyuan Community License; **not licensed for use in the EU, UK, or South Korea**;
  verify exact terms per model before any redistribution-sensitive use.
- **Hunyuan3D-MLX (Xiong, full pipeline) code**: MIT, tracked in this repo at
  `hunyuan_mlx/`, safe to clone and modify freely (weights are the license-restricted
  part, downloaded separately).
- **Hunyuan3D-MLX (dgrauet shape) code**: Tencent Hunyuan Community License, not MIT;
  the code itself, not just the weights, carries the same restriction. Stays vendor-cloned
  rather than tracked in this repo for that reason.
- **BRIA RMBG-2.0 is disabled** by patch and must stay unloaded in the TRELLIS pipeline.
  Inputs must carry a real transparent alpha foreground; the pipeline refuses anything else
  unless you explicitly pass `--allow-rembg`.
- Every run emits a `.provenance.json` sidecar (hashes, settings, license classification,
  component licenses).

## Credits

This repo trains nothing and invents nothing; it builds upon other people's models and
work. What it *does* add is filling the gaps that exist to make some of these models work
on Apple Silicon, and improving the overall experience. Grateful to everyone who built
before me; they are named and credited in
[`docs/info_and_credits.md`](docs/info_and_credits.md). Also a special thanks to Claude
and Codex for being my partners through this! Not just helping me build, but teaching me
so much along the way. Yes, I just credited AI.
