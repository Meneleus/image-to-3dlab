"""Queued finishing jobs for the browser: retopologise, repaint, compress an existing GLB.

Deliberately a sibling of `rig_api.py` rather than part of `generate_api.py`: this operates
on an asset that already exists, so it has no image-to-3D backend, no model readiness and no
setup. What it shares is the job shape — one at a time, SSE progress, artifacts fetched by
URL — so the browser can drive it with the same code it already uses.

Finishing an asset the viewer generated earlier is the point: the surface response
(`metallic`/`roughness`/`ior`) is tuned per asset by eye, and re-finishing with different
values must not mean regenerating the geometry underneath it.
